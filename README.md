## 🚀 About Me  
I’m an aspiring developer who thrives on tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions. With a curiosity-driven mindset, I explore both the frontend and backend, always seeking to expand my skill set and deepen my understanding of technology. I enjoy building projects that not only solve real-world problems but also push the boundaries of what I know.

Whether I’m writing JavaScript to create interactive UIs or using Python for data-driven applications, I’m committed to developing clean, efficient, and scalable code. I’m always excited about new opportunities to collaborate, learn, and grow in this fast-evolving field.
